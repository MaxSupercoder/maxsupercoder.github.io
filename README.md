# Max Ang Portfolio

**Project One purpose and requirements**

Create an online Portfolio for yourself with a minimum of 3 pages.
Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users. Attribute any code from other sources. Document all testing procedures and findings.

Use Git & GitHub for version control. Make sure you are adding, committing and pushing your code regularly throughout creating your project.

**User Goals**

To create a personal portfolio that I can progressively update throughout my career.

**Design Choices**

I chose to go for a simple, elegant design with a clean aesthetic.

**Features**

Home page – This includes a simple blurb ‘about me.’
Next tab – Provides some basic education information and a ‘Technical skills’ section (this is not accurate at the moment, it is something that I can correct at the end of this course and in the future).

Second Next tab – This is a place holder for more information on education and/or skills that I will develop in the future.

Third Next tab – this takes you back to the home page.

Contact - I have not filled in email or phone number since I dont like spam.

Portfolio – Current and past projects that I have done.

Other Projects – This is a space to add future projects.

Credits – This includes attribution for the graphic images used. 

Settings – As an extra bonus I have added the option to change the background picture in settings.  I may add more features in the future.
